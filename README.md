This is a simple frontend made to get basics statistics from covid19.

## Installation
This is a SPA made with react so after clone you must run the following command on terminal.

## Environment Variables
In this app i use a unique environment variable `REACT_APP_BEHOST`, create a .env file and set it variable with the url where is hosted the backend. Example:
